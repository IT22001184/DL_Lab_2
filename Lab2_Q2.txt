1.What happens when the number of hidden nodes increase?
The nueral network becomes ore capable of learning complex patterns in data. 
With very fex node, the model may underfit and fail to capture the shape of the data.
Incraesing the nodesgenerally improves accuracy, but aftre a certain number of nodes, the improvement becomes smaller.
Too mant nodes may lead to overfitting, especially if the dataset is small.

2.Can you explain the pattern of the accuracy when the hidden nodes increase?
Accuracy rises quickly for small numbers of hidden nodes.
Accuracy plateaus aftre reaching suffiencient hidden nodes.
Adding too many nodes may not improve test accuracy further.
