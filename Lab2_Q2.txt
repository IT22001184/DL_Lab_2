1.What happens when the number of hidden nodes increase?
The nueral network becomes more capable of learning complex patterns in data. 
With very few nodes, the model may underfit and fail to capture the shape of the data.
Increasing the nodes generally improves accuracy, but after a certain number of nodes, the improvement becomes smaller.
Too many nodes may lead to overfitting, especially if the dataset is small.

2.Can you explain the pattern of the accuracy when the hidden nodes increase?
Accuracy rises quuickly for small numbers of hidden nodes.
Accuracy plateaus aftre reaching suffiencient hidden nodes.
Adding too many nodes may not improve test accuracy further.
